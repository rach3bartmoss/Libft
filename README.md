## Libft: My very first own C Library.

**Insightfull error-handling implementations of standard C functions, with some glimpses of topics such as: singly linked lists, structs and Makefiles**

**Libft** is a fundamental project for C developers. It provides a collection of custom implementations of standard C functions, along with additional utility functions. Here are the key features:

- **String Manipulation**: Functions like `ft_strlen`, `ft_strcpy`, and `ft_strcmp`.
- **Memory Management**: Includes `ft_memset`, `ft_memcpy`, and `ft_memalloc`.
- **Linked Lists**: Basic singly linked list utilities such as `ft_lstnew`, `ft_lstadd`, and `ft_lstdel`.
- **Utility Functions**: Such as `ft_atoi`, `ft_itoa`, `ft_split`, `ft_substr` and more.
- **Error Handling**: Robust implementations with error checks.
- **Makefiles**: Learn how to create Makefiles for efficient compilation.

Feel free to explore the **libft** repository, integrate it into your projects, and enhance your C programming skills! ðŸš€
